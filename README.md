New Approach.

Step 1, get all the URLs from the database, these urls are direct to the wait times pages. No search/crawl required. 
(In DB structure mention how many hospital's waittimes are in there. Some have mutiple.)

Step 2, have a vision based model scan the webpages "snapshot" to find the wait times and the corresponding address/hospital name.

Step 3, store these extracted times into a new db for waittimes and hospitals with corresponding names and addresses.
